# downgrade-kid

Some pixels from an old adventure, just because I liked it, I like it, and I will like it. Blocks have a size of 8x8 instead of 16x16 from original game, but I tried to keep original palette.

Original idea by Inusawa, Taro, Mr. Haigo, Makorin, Ban Ban, Yoshikawa, Togawa, Hip Tanaka, S. Okada, G. Yokoi, and others from R&D1 in the 80's. Thank you guys! Thank you bin N!
